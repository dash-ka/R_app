Inspired by a well-known Kaggle Competition "Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster", this application is intended to provide a funny way to start with machine learning.
It creates a learning environment to predict the fate of the passengers aboard the Titanic, which famously sank in the Atlantic ocean in 1912.
In a step by step process, the user is invited to build a predictive model that answers the question: 
'what sorts of people were more likely to survive?' The problem, seen as a simple classification task, will be addressed using decision tree algorithm.

The Home tab introduces the learning task and provides an overview on the dataset which will be later used in the analysis.

The "DATA" tab aims at making the user familiar with the data and is composed of two sections :

 - "Explore" section allows two different display modes :
    the default one enables the user to learn the structure of the data,
    wheares the second one displays the summary statistics to support the user in her explorative analysis.
  
 - "Visualize" section enables a graphical representation of the feature relationships.
  
The "MODEL" tab is focused on the actual implementation of the learning algorithm. 
The user can build her first decision tree model by performing the tuning of main hyperparameters,
train the model with the best combination of hyperparameters output in the tuning process and evaluate the model performance.

Finally, the user can visualize her decision tree classifier through an interactive graph in the very last section.
The resulting model is ready to be used in the prediction task!
