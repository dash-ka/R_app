Inspired by a well-known Kaggle Competition "Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster", this application is intended to provide a funny way to start with machine learning.
It creates a learning environment to predict the fate of the passengers aboard the Titanic, which famously sank in the Atlantic ocean in 1912.
In a step by step process, the user is invited to build a predictive model that answers the question: 
'what sorts of people were more likely to survive?' The problem, seen as a simple classification task, will be addressed using decision tree algorithm.
